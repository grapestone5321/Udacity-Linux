## Configuring Linux Web Servers
Your First Ubuntu Server

In this course you'll learn the basic Linux fundamentals every web developer needs to know to share their web applications with the world! 

You'll get a basic Python WSGI application up and running within a Vagrant virtual machine that queries data from a PostgreSQL database.

You'll start by exploring various Linux distributions and learning the differences between a number of them. 

You'll then explore how the Linux operating system differs from other operating systems you may be more familiar with. 

With this base knowledge, you'll then move into Linux security - covering topics such as file permissions, user management, package management and configuring firewalls.

Finally, you'll transform a safe and secure baseline server into a web application server by installing and configuring the Apache HTTP Server and PostgreSQL database server.
