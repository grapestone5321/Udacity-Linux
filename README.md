## 1. Linux Command Line Basics
https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud595

Getting Started with the Shell

We have built this course for beginners who have no experience with the Linux system and the command-line interface.

In this course, you'll learn the basics of the command line interface of a Linux server: the terminal and shell (GNU Bash). 

This course includes an introduction to files and directories in the Linux filesystem.



### Lesson 1: Get Into the Shell
Get started using a terminal! Learn how to enter commands in the shell and interpret their output.

## 2. Configuring Linux Web Servers
https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud299

Your First Ubuntu Server

In this course you'll learn the basic Linux fundamentals every web developer needs to know to share their web applications with the world! 

You'll get a basic Python WSGI application up and running within a Vagrant virtual machine that queries data from a PostgreSQL database.

You'll start by exploring various Linux distributions and learning the differences between a number of them. 

You'll then explore how the Linux operating system differs from other operating systems you may be more familiar with. 

With this base knowledge, you'll then move into Linux security - covering topics such as file permissions, user management, package management and configuring firewalls.

Finally, you'll transform a safe and secure baseline server into a web application server by installing and configuring the Apache HTTP Server and PostgreSQL database server.
